# Visualising-Van-Ecks-sequence
A short implementation of the very interesting Van Ecks sequence in R in order to plot the value distribution.
The used algorithm is heavily based on the Maple example of N. J. A. Sloane: https://oeis.org/A181391

A graphical sample output of the R code is attached, the algorithm is described in more detail in the code comments.
The sequence itself is described in this video by Numberphile: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etMJxB-igrc
